## 1. Physical layer
### a. Overview
  + The physical layer is the lowest layer. This layer provides mechanical, electrical and other functional aids available to enable or disable, they maintain and transmit bits about physical connections. This may for example be electrical signals, optical signals (optical fiber, laser), electromagnetic waves (wireless networks) or sound. The techniques used are called technical transmission process. Devices and network components that are associated with the physical layer, for example, the antenna and the amplifier, plug and socket for the network cable, the repeater, the stroke, the transceiver, the T-bar and the terminator are (Terminator).

  + Its physical layer digital bit transfer is accomplished on a wireline or cable-free transmission path. The sharing of a transmission medium can be carried out on this layer by static multiplexing and dynamic multiplexing. This requires not only the specifications of certain transmission media (for example, copper cable, fiber optic cable, power grid) and the definition of connectors further elements. Furthermore, it must be resolved at this level, in what way a single bit to be transmitted.

  + This means the following: In computer networks today information is generally transmitted in the form of bit or symbol sequences. In copper cables and radio transmission, however, are modulated high frequency electromagnetic waves, the information carrier, in the optical waveguide light waves of a certain wavelength or different. The information carrier know no bit strings, but can take a lot more different states than just 0 or 1. For each type of transmission must therefore encoding are defined. That is due to the specification of the physical layer of a network.

  Typical hardware on this layer: repeaters, hubs, cables, plugs,...
